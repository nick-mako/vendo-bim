    text: "The Storm box 2 is simply incredible! I bought mine and am very satisfied. The sound quality is excellent, with deep and powerful bass, and the volume fills the room without distortion. The battery has great longevity and the design is very robust, perfect to take anywhere. Additionally, the Bluetooth has an excellent range and the connection is super stable. I recommend it for those who want quality and portable sound!",

    text: "The speakers are great, but the seller's delivery service is horrible. They were in transit from the warehouse for 2 weeks. They don't answer questions or make adjustments; you have to call for hours. They have a 5-day consideration period for each issue, but my request was processed in 10 days. I hope the seller stops working with this shipping company and instead sends it via local mail, where you can safely pick it up.",
